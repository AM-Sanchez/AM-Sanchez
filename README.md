My name is Alex Sanchez and I am a software developer 💻, collaborator, remote team lead, technology enthusiast, and consumer of electronic music and sci-fi/fantasy novels. 

Currently, I work as a software product lead and individual contributor for a cross-platform data center modeling GUI application written in C++/Qt used as part of a suite of DCIM (Data center infrastructure management) tools.

I have over 7 years of professional software development experience writing C++, Qt framework, Python, and Golang (primarily the former).

My passion lies in creating the most performant, efficient, memory-safe, and inutitive software products possible while collaborating with others, continuosuly improving my skillsets, and expanding my knowledge. I look foward to working together and hope you'll reach out!
